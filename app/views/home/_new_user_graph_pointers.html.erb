	<h1>Welcome to ChartMyCycles!</h1>
We're honored that you chose our charting software and we're excited to see you nurture your body.<br /><br />

<h1>Adding a new entry</h1>
See that shiny green button on the left? When you wake up you'll need to take your temperature. We find using a basal thermometer works best. Once you've got your waking temperature, click that button and record your temp. Check any of the other boxes that apply to your body that day and you're done! Just rinse and repeat.<br /><br />
<h1>Settling in</h1>
While you wait to make your first entry (tomorrow morning!), take a few minutes to customize your profile. Upload your own profile picture, set your status, and edit your profile settings on the left.
<br /><br />
Or, If you want to start your cycle on a day different from today's date, simply click "Customize this cycle" on the left and change the cycle start date.
